#Back-end Developer Coding Challenge

## Goal:

In this challenge, you will have to setup a backend REST API that allows a user to fetch a list of all users and albums, authenticates a user and fetches their specific photos and albums.

that has the following endpoints:

- /users to fetch all users (unauthenticated)
- /albums to fetch all albums associated with the user (authenticated)
- /photos to fetch all photos associated with the user (authenticated)
- /albums/:id to return a specific album (authenticated)
- /photos/:id to return a specific photo (authenticated)

Use data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to setup a JSON file that will act as your "database".

Suggested Frameworks:

- NestJS

#### Develop a Back-end app that allows a user to see their albums and its' associated photographs

- [ ] Fork this repo. Keep it public until we have been able to review it.
- [ ] Use any language/framework you are comfortable with.
- [ ] User/Albums/Photos structure similar to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
- [ ] App should restrict some routes and not others
- [ ] Integration and Unit test a single function or route.
- [ ] Setup appropriate interfaces

### Evaluation:

- [ ] App operates and fulfills above criteria
- [ ] No crashes or bugs
- [ ] Follow Clean Code and SOLID principles
- [ ] Code is understandable and maintainable
